**ACME Insurance Charges Prediction**
*Project Overview*
This project involves an extensive analysis and predictive modeling of insurance charges for ACME Insurance. The main steps include exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and developing a linear regression machine learning model. The aim is to predict insurance charges based on several features: age, number of children, smoking status, region, and BMI.
*Introduction*

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model for insurance charges based on customer demographics and habits. By analyzing historical data, we can uncover patterns and relationships that help predict future charges.

*Data Description*
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:
age: Age of the customer.
sex: Gender of the customer.
bmi: Body Mass Index of the customer.
children: Number of children the customer has.
smoker: Whether the customer is a smoker (yes/no).
region: Region where the customer lives.
charges: Medical charges billed by the insurance.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

In the EDA phase, we will:

* Visualize distributions of individual features.
* Explore relationships between features and the target variable (charges).
* Identify any potential data quality issues.
* Data Cleaning
* Data cleaning involves:

Handling missing values (if any).

Treating outliers.

Ensuring data types are appropriate for analysis.

Feature Engineering

Feature engineering steps include:

Encoding categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Scaling numerical features if necessary.
Creating interaction terms or polynomial features if they improve the model.

Modeling
In the modeling phase:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a linear regression model on the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance on the test data using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
